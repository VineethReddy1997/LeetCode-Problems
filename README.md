# 🚀 LeetCode Problems — Python DSA Practice

Welcome to my **LeetCode DSA Practice Repository**! 👨‍💻  
This repo is a structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms problems** solved in **Python**, with explanations, brute-force and optimized solutions, and step-by-step problem-solving patterns.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Strengthen **core Data Structures & Algorithms** skills.
- Prepare for **technical interviews** for Python Backend and ML Engineer roles.
- Learn **problem-solving patterns** like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, HashMap, Recursion, and Dynamic Programming.
- Maintain a **daily coding habit** and track progress over time.
