Welcome to my **LeetCode DSA Practice Repository**! 👨‍💻  
This repository contains structured **Data Structures & Algorithms problems** solved in **Python**, with **brute-force and optimized solutions**, **step-by-step explanations**, and **pattern-based approaches**.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

This repo is designed to :

- 💪 Strengthen **core DSA skills**  
- 🏹 Prepare for **technical interviews** (Python Backend & ML roles)  
- 🧩 Learn **problem-solving patterns** like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, HashMap, Recursion & DP  
- 📈 Track **daily coding practice** and improvement
